                <h3> <a class="link1" href="">I used to be a pack rat</a> . I had so many things that I thought that I
                    loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
                    any of it because there was too much.
                </h3>
                <h3>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't
                    hold a
                    relationship.</h3>
                <h4>How I turned things around</h4>
                <h3> <a class="link1" href="">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</a>. I
                    literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
                    sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                </h3>
                <h3>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to
                    do. And it worked.
                </h3>
                <h4>Now I live the simple life</h4>
                <h3>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                    more, and I have
                    more free time to enjoy.
                </h3>

                <h3>With how much it turned my life around,<a class="link1" href="">I felt like I had no choice but to
                        start sharing how I did it</a> , and how others
                    can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
